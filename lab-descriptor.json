  "introduction": "Welcome to Smart Structures and Dynamics Laboratory (VSSDL). This laboratory provides platform to inquisitive students to perform basic experiments related to smart structures and structural dynamics, either remotely or through simulation.<br/><br/>A smart structure is defined as a structural system having built-in or intrinsic sensors, actuators and control mechanism whereby it is capable of sensing a stimulus, responding to it in a predetermined manner and extent, in a short time, and reverting to its original state as soon as the stimulus is removed. In the present context, the structures have been instrumented with smart piezoelectric material based sensors, which inform the status (here dynamic characteristics) to the user.",
